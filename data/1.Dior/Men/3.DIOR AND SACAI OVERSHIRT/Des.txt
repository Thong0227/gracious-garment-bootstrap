The overshirt is part of the DIOR AND SACAI collaboration. Crafted in blue raw cotton denim, it is distinguished by a mix of fabrics that offer subtle contrast, while a black DIOR AND SACAI patch embellishes the chest. The style is accented by snap-button side slits, a double chest pocket and a drawstring hem. The overshirt will easily pair with matching DIOR AND SACAI jeans to complete the look.
