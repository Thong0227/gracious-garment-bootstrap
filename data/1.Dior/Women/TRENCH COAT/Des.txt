The beige trench coat presents a refined new take on an essential wardrobe piece. Crafted in cotton, it is enhanced by a contrasting embroidered bee on the front, a key symbol of the House. The adjustable side placket highlights the waist, while topstitched details and pointed pockets with buttoned flaps create a sophisticated look. The trench coat may be paired with any piece for a casual or elegant look.
