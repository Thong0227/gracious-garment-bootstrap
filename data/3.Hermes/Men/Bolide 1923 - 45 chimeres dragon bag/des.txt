Bag in Togo calfskin and tufting with palladium plated hardware

The Chimera effect: An unexpected menagerie for an exceptional effect! Fantastical creatures from Greek myths and antique ceramics feature on the Bolide 1923-45, the Plume FT 45 and the Cityback 27. Thanks to the technique of tufting, a type of embroidery completed directly on the leather, then leveled to the surface, the monsters take on a suede effect. These chimeras hug the shape of the object and come to life through the softness of their fur.
